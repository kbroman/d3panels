[Karl W Broman](https://kbroman.org)

This is a set of [D3](https://d3js.org)-based graphics panels, to
be combined into larger multi-panel charts.  They were developed for
the [R/qtlcharts](https://kbroman.org/qtlcharts) package.

Note that d3panels uses
[D3 version 7](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/main/API.md).
(It should also work with version 6.)

There are other libraries with similar goals that are of more general
use (e.g., [C3.js](http://c3js.org));
see
[this list of javascript chart libraries](https://blog.webkid.io/javascript-chart-libraries/)),
but I wanted charts that were a bit _less_ general and flexible, but
rather more specific to my particular applications (and style).

For snapshots and live tests, see <https://kbroman.org/d3panels>.
